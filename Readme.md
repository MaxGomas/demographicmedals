**You:**

What would be a useful graph to help analyze this data?

**Copilot:**

To analyze the medal tally data effectively, here are a few useful graphs you could consider:

1. **Bar Chart:** A bar chart can show the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals each country has won. This makes it easy to compare the performance of different countries at a glance.
2. **Stacked Bar Chart:** This variation of the bar chart stacks the medals on top of each other, providing a clear visual of the total medal count for each country while still showing the breakdown of gold, silver, and bronze medals.
3. **Pie Chart:** A pie chart can illustrate the proportion of total medals won by each country. This is useful for understanding the overall distribution of medals among the top countries.
4. **Population vs. Medals Scatter Plot:** A scatter plot with population on the x-axis and total medals on the y-axis can help analyze the relationship between a country‚Äôs population and its medal count. This can highlight countries that perform exceptionally well relative to their population size.
5. **Medals per Capita:** A bar chart showing medals per capita (total medals divided by population) can provide insights into which countries are the most efficient in winning medals relative to their population size.

Would you like help creating any of these graphs?

### Python

Starting to build a classic medal tally in order to read data correctly. The previous table has been imported as a .csv
```
def plot_medals_tally(df)
```
![imgaeTally](graphs/medaltally.png)

*what's worth noticing is that GitHub Copilot understood the context and even propose to color stack bar accordingly. I had to iterate in order to display medal count*

After that, cracking the medal per cap data display
```
def plot_medals_vs_medals_per_million(df)
```
![imgaeTally](graphs/matrix_permil.png)

*I made Copilot understand exactly what I wanted. two adjustment were to convert the dataframe column in real numbers (removing ","), then asking for some space when displaying labels*

**You:**

What can you understand from this?

*pasted the file just below in order to make copilot understand findings and ask for complementary analysis*

**Copilot:**

The scatter plot titled ‚ÄúTotal Medals vs. Medal per Million Inhabitants‚Äù provides a dual perspective on the performance of countries in the Paris 2024 Olympics:

- **Total Medals:** The y-axis represents the total number of medals won by each country. Countries like the United States and China are positioned higher on this axis, indicating they have won a large number of medals.
- **Medals per Million Inhabitants:** The x-axis shows the number of medals won per million inhabitants. This metric helps to understand how efficient countries are in winning medals relative to their population size. Countries like Australia and Great Britain are positioned further to the right, indicating a higher number of medals per million inhabitants.

**Key Insights:**

- **High Total Medals, Low Medals per Capita:** The United States and China have a high total medal count but a lower number of medals per million inhabitants. This suggests that while they are dominant in terms of total medals, their large populations mean the medals are spread thinly across their inhabitants.
- **Balanced Performance:** Countries like France and Great Britain have a good balance, performing well in both total medals and medals per capita.
- **High Medals per Capita:** Australia and the Netherlands, despite having fewer total medals, excel in medals per capita, indicating a high efficiency in winning medals relative to their population size.

This graph is useful for understanding not just the raw medal counts but also the efficiency and relative performance of countries based on their population sizes.

**You:**

How could you explain this result? You need to develop at least demographic, historic, and business (investment in sports) axes, maybe you can find more.

**Copilot:**

The scatter plot showing ‚ÄúTotal Medals vs. Medal per Million Inhabitants‚Äù can be explained through several axes, including demographic, historic, business (investment in sports), and more. Let‚Äôs delve into each:

1. **Demographic Axis**
   - **Population Size:** Countries with larger populations, like the United States and China, have a larger pool of athletes to select from, which often translates to a higher total medal count. However, their medals per capita might be lower because the medals are spread across a larger population.
   - **Population Density and Urbanization:** Countries with higher urbanization rates may have better access to sports facilities and training centers, contributing to higher medal counts.

2. **Historic Axis**
   - **Sporting Tradition:** Countries with a long history of participation in international sports events often have established systems for identifying and nurturing talent. For example, the United States has a strong tradition in athletics and swimming, contributing to their high medal counts.
   - **Cultural Importance of Sports:** In some countries, certain sports are deeply ingrained in the culture, leading to higher participation rates and better performance. For instance, cricket in Australia and field hockey in the Netherlands.

3. **Business (Investment in Sports) Axis**
   - **Government Funding:** Countries that invest heavily in sports infrastructure, training programs, and athlete support tend to perform better. For example, Australia‚Äôs Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has been pivotal in their Olympic success.
   - **Private Sponsorship:** Corporate sponsorships and endorsements can provide athletes with the financial support needed to train full-time and access top-tier coaching and facilities.
   - **Sports Science and Technology:** Investment in sports science, including nutrition, psychology, and biomechanics, can give athletes a competitive edge. Countries like the United States and China are known for their advanced sports science programs.

4. **Socio-Economic Axis**
   - **Economic Prosperity:** As a wealthy nation, Australia can afford to invest in sports infrastructure and programs. This economic stability allows for sustained investment in athlete development.
   - **Education Systems:** Australia‚Äôs education system integrates sports into the curriculum, promoting physical activity and identifying talent from a young age.

5. **Political Axis**
   - **National Pride:** Success in international sports is a source of national pride for Australia. This drives both public and private investment in sports, as well as strong support for athletes.

6. **Geographic Axis**
   - **Climate and Geography:** Australia‚Äôs favorable climate allows for year-round outdoor training and competition. The country‚Äôs diverse geography also supports a wide range of sports, from swimming to athletics.

7. **Psychological Axis**
   - **Motivation and Mental Toughness:** Australian athletes are known for their resilience and competitive spirit. The country‚Äôs sports programs often include mental health and sports psychology support, helping athletes perform under pressure.

**Conclusion:**
Australia‚Äôs success in the Olympics is a result of a combination of favorable demographics, a strong sporting tradition, significant investment in sports, and supportive socio-economic conditions. Their efficient use of resources and focus on sports science and technology further enhance their performance, making them one of the top-performing countries relative to their population size.
